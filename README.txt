My program is a scene of a castle with the sun and moon rising and setting above it. 

I have loaded and displayed a number of images from outside the program. These include the sun, the moon, the catsle, as well as others. These images are in the 'imgs' folder. I have also filled the green ground and blue sky using the SDL_Rect class. Additioanlly, the stars were created using the SDL_Rect class. My animation is the rising and setting of the sun and the moon, as well as the twinkling of the stars. The sky also changes colors depending on the time of day.

My program can be run by typing 'make' and then './my_game'. This will cause a window to pop up dipslaying my drawing/animation. 

right now, my animation seems to move quickly on the joey machine and slowly on the babbage machine. I am not sure why.
